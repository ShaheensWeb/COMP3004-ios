Week 8 - Sean Ghazazani - COMP3004 Logs

This week flushed UI out for the iPhone, and swapped the healthkit request stuff back to the iPhone in an attempt
to test the previous bug found in week3-4 with the issue of getting the users health kit data to be turned on
so that HKWorkoutSession is initializable from the WorkoutManager. 

The UI for the iphone still needs more work and I'm completely lost on 
getting the HeartRate to be recorded over averages of 1 min, the data seems to come in every 5 seconds
but I cant seem to make a timed look or a timer, will need more research for creating TIMED Heart rate data
as nowhere online seems to be able to help me in atleast instructing me. 

A loss of functionality seems to occur everytime, but will continue pushing.
