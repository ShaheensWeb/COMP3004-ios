Week 4 -

A lot more research done on watchkit OS, learned about how
the code base works

links to above:https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/ConfiguringYourXcodeProject.html

A lot more watch kit guides, youtube videos, and I have successfully launched the iWatch simulator to just say my name.

Next I will progress today, to make it say "Start" on the button after launching the iOS app, record your heart rate
for 1 min and vomit the average over the minute back to you. Doing this 3 times, printing the values.
