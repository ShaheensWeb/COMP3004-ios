Week 4 - COMP 3004


This week I went over a lot of actually beginning implementation. Looking at the 
possible presentations and began writing my first bit of code. 

I had to learn online about the storyboard, using youtube guides really
about dragging and dropping modal buttons, creating views that push to other views
(the previous version is now deprecated use to just be a push() function you clicked after dropping)

But finally some coding, and I began to feel like I really understand how iOS apps are mode, like how
other applications have loading icons via the loading storyboard view, and a lot more. Can't wait to continue.
