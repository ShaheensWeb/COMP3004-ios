Week 11 Text- 

In the attempt to match the development analysis presented in D1 I tried super super hard along with James
to get WatchConnectivity to work (this is confirmable because I literally left the code commented out in the
view controller for both mobile/iwatch) and no matter what we did we couldnt get over a simple bug that Stackoverflow
after countless threads couldn't resolve only a week old. Once again Watch OS 4.0 has busted functionality and were lost.

Aside from that we got the UI flushed a bit better, we created final pages aka the result pages, and because
of the watch connectivity bug began developing a MockData button to possibly mock heart rate 1 and 2 for
phases 1 and 2 respectively for demo, also James got the timers functioning again and were getting closer to D4 demos!

See you next week
