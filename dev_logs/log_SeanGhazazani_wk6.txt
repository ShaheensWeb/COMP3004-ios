Week 6 - COMP 3004


Solved the healthkit issue partially, looked it up online and found that this is really just a genuine
bug with being on the most up-to-date version of iWatch/iOS/xCode so I found a workout by placing
a request for the healthkit in the iwatch instead of the iphone, and building it. Seems to have
a bit of a performance hit, but honestly not else sure how to meet the requirement of demo'ing on a physical device.

Beyond that I believe me and James have almost fully flushed out what we want the end concept of the UI to look like in best case,
the possible warnings we need to due this application including consumption of alcohol to ofcourse, test alcoholism, and much more.
