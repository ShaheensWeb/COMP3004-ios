Week 9 - COMP 3004

The iphone has a complete age check, that does not allow the user to continue without it (needs a bit of actual prettier designs still), 
secondly the iphone has a guide on the application works, once again not that aesthetic since were only 2 team members design has been
sacrificed in purely trying to meet the requirements in the given time period. 

After that began researching really three topics
(1) -> how do I get the data to be shown on the users iphone screen while they do the test aka passing the data back to
make the iphone screen atleast functional and useful during the test beyond the age check, and explanation. 
(2) -> how to time Heart rate data thats incoming over a min, stop after the minute and get the average, and do this one
other time after the user consumes alcohol
(3) -> what benchmark #'s determine "alcoholism" aka 20% increase, 25% increase, so on so forth.

If I can fully complete the 3 things above the application is pretty much done fully, but to be honest im really
scared about #2.
