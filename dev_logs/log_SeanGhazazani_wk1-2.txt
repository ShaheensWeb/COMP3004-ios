Spent a lot of time researching WATCHKIT OS 2 and the compatibility with heart rate. Also spent time looking into
the science behind the study, how I will be able to capture this all in the app. Original estimation I see it being 
around 10 slides possibly max, 10 different view points when drawn out. Will be pushing the xCode project, for now 
SanityCheck is just a hello world project and pushed. 

Will be finishing the watch sync soon, and get the heart rate monitored in real time then go over
recording averages over a length of time.
