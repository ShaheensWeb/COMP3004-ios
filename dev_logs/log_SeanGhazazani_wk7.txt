Week 7 - Sean Ghazazani - COMP3004 Logs

Finally got the watch taking information that is real, this took about honestly sadly to say
5-6 hours to get off mock data and using real data.

It was honestly a 3am and im just grinning like a mad man because I thought
for the longest time I wouldn't be able to get the only thing I need to make this 
application process. 

From this point onward I can proudly state this iwatch application is pretty much achieveing
what the heart rate app on the iwatch does, reporting your heart rate back minus all the cool
notifications for hitting benchmarks like 160, or 180 BPM. 

Now we begin flushing the UI, and most importantly seeing if its possible to time the heart
rate beyond just flushing it. Also the iPhone now that it doesn't request healthkit data
or have any UI really beyond saying go to watch needs to be flushed with a warning and a 
age check, and more as stated in previous weekly logs.
