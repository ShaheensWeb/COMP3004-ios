Week 5 - COMP 3004


Began testing the watch via paying for the 99$ iOS fee and using a physical device can't seem to get
the iwatch to request the HealthKit data from the users watch, this debugging found no success for over 2 hours. 

I'm not quite sure why, continued work on the UI and began drawing out the final concept views.

Flushing out whats possible and whats not, now that we have lost 50% of our group after they have been missing for 2-3 weeks. 

It's going to be a long semester.
