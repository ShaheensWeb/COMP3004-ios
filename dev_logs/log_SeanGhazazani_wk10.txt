Week 10 - COMP 3004


Follow up from last times research and the answers:


(1) -> how do I get the data to be shown on the users iphone screen while they do the test aka passing the data back to
make the iphone screen atleast functional and useful during the test beyond the age check, and explanation. 

Still no luck, this is begining to be harder then I thought. Seems like they are really fully seperate apps and communication
is hard to understand. 

(2) -> how to time Heart rate data thats incoming over a min, stop after the minute and get the average, and do this one
other time after the user consumes alcohol

Still no luck, but did create a functional timer so I can atleast make the user see a UI screen with a timer once they hit
start app so they know how long it takes even if the iphone doesnt show there heart rate, it can show the timer while i Iwatch
shows the user there heart rate for that indivudal minute, hopefully after the minute I can sync with (1) above to get the iphone
returning the final avg to that screen before the user begins consuming alcohol, and test phase 2 occurs. 

(3) -> what benchmark #'s determine "alcoholism" aka 20% increase, 25% increase, so on so forth.

Seems to be anything beyond a 10-15% increase, is a safe bet. Once again the intro explanation explains how
this test can be butchered by running on spot or anything, but if the user follows rules and still gets an increased
heart rate even though the consumed alcohol is naturally a sepressent would confirm i guess "green"
 for alcoholism, if heart rate is between - infinity to 10% bigger, they should be fine and be considered negligible. 

From now on out of fear of not meeting requirements im purely focused on completion of the APPS requirements
and getting the timed heart rate data back, doing this twice and finally a green and red screen would
allow us to completion.
